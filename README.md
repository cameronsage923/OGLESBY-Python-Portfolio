# Oglesby-Python-Portfolio
# Welcome to my Python portfolio!
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my projects completed as part of my data science coursework. It includes examples of my work in data visualization, analysis, and modeling using Python. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to organize, analyze, and interpret data to reveal meaningful insights.

# Future Projects...

I plan to organize this repository into folders grouping each project by their focus (i.e. exploratory data analysis, visualizations, modeling, etc.). Within each folder, each project will be further organized individually to include any datasets, code, and other relevant materials, as well as a project summary/description.
