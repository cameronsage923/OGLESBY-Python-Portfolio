# Welcome to my Python portfolio.
The **purpose** of this repository is to showcase my projects completed as part of my data science coursework. It will include examples of my work in **data visualization**, **analysis**, and **modeling** using Python. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to organize, analyze, and interpret data to reveal meaningful insights.

# My Projects

### The Penguin App üêß

In this portfolio, I have uploaded my first data visualization project: The Penguin App! Please see my basic-streamlit-app folder for more details.

### Tidy Data Project üèÖ
[View the Repository](https://github.com/cameronsage923/TidyData-Project)

Description: This project applies tidy data principles to clean and analyze an Olympic dataset! 
It includes data wrangling, visualization, and pivot tables to summarize key insights.

This file **fits into my portfolio** by showcasing my ability to clean and structure "messy" data. It also displays my exploratory analysis skills and my ability to create meaningful visualizations. Building upon my previous data analytics work, this project strengthens my Python skills and data science best practices.

### üîç Named Entity Recognition (NER) App üìä

[View the full NER App Project](https://github.com/cameronsage923/OGLESBY-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp) 

Description: A custom Streamlit web app that allows users to explore Named Entity Recognition using spaCy. Users can input or upload text, define custom entity labels using spaCy's `EntityRuler`, and instantly visualize the recognized entities highlighted within the text. Includes visual charts and interactive features.

I plan to organize this repository into folders grouping each project by their focus (i.e. exploratory data analysis, visualizations, modeling, etc.). Within each folder, each project will be further organized individually to include any datasets, code, and other relevant materials, as well as a project summary/description.
