# Welcome to my Python portfolio.
The **purpose** of this repository is to showcase my projects completed as part of my data science coursework. It will include examples of my work in **data visualization**, **analysis**, and **modeling** using Python. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to organize, analyze, and interpret data to reveal meaningful insights.

# View my first project now: The Penguin App! üêß

In this portfolio, I have uploaded my first data visualization project: The Penguin App! Please see my basic-streamlit-app folder for more details.

# Future Projects...

I plan to organize this repository into folders grouping each project by their focus (i.e. exploratory data analysis, visualizations, modeling, etc.). Within each folder, each project will be further organized individually to include any datasets, code, and other relevant materials, as well as a project summary/description.
