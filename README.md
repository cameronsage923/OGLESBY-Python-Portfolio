# Cameron Oglesby: Python Portfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio — a curated collection of interactive, real-world applications built with **Streamlit**, focused on data visualization, natural language processing, and financial modeling.

Each project blends concepts from my coursework in **finance, real estate, and computing** at the University of Notre Dame with hands-on technical development using Python, Streamlit, and key data libraries.
