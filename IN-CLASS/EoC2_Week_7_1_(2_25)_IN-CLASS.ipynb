Reverse the Entire Array:**\n","- Reversing the whole array prepares it so that the elements we need at the front end up at the beginning when partially reversed again. The entire array is reversed using `nums[::-1]`.\n","\n","**3.   Reverse the First k Elements:**\n","- The first k elements of the reversed array are reversed again.
