# The Penguin App 🐧
Welcome! This is a simple interactive web app built with Streamlit that visualizes data from the Palmer Penguins dataset. This app allows users to filter penguin data by island, species, and body mass, and view the results dynamically.

## 📊 Project Overview
The Penguin App was developed as an introduction to building interactive data apps using Streamlit. It demonstrates how to:
- Load and display structured data using pandas
- Add interactive filters and sliders
- Dynamically update charts or tables based on user input

The dataset contains measurements for 344 penguins across several species and islands in Antarctica, collected by researchers at the Palmer Station.

## App Preview
Below is a preview of the Penguin App interface:
