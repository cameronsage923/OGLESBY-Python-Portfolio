# 🏢 Multifamily Value-Add Deal Visualizer & Waterfall Modeler
Welcome! This is an interactive web app built with Streamlit that helps users explore how real estate private equity firms analyze and structure multifamily value-add investments. The app is designed to make complex real estate deal modeling approachable—whether you're a student, an aspiring investor, or just curious about how these deals work.

## 📊 Project Overview
In a multifamily value-add deal, investors acquire underperforming apartment properties and increase their value through renovations, improved operations, and rent growth. These projects generate returns by increasing the property’s income and selling it at a higher valuation.

This app brings that concept to life by allowing users to:

- 🧮 Model renovation costs, rent growth, stabilized income, and exit values
- 💧 Simulate IRR-based equity waterfalls with LP/GP return splits
- 📈 Visualize projected financials across a multi-year holding period
- 📘 Learn key real estate finance terms with plain-English explanations

The app applies concepts I learned in real estate and finance courses at Notre Dame—and reflects my personal interest in the field of real estate private equity.
