Dowd will be there, as well as former president Barack Obama, and rumor has it Breen-Phillips is making swamp punch. First 50 get free glow-in-the-dark rosaries. Be there or be excommunicated.",

He loves Lord of the Rings and uses easter eggs to make class more fun. Though he is a full-time Python weapon these days, he used to be a comedian! What a guy.",

My date spilled Spinelli‚Äôs ranch on my dress, but we still ended up in Dahnke. Tomorrow I have a finance quiz with Professor Ackerman and a group project for Professor Balko's class in Mendoza. Pray for me.",

I peaked during SYR season and now spend most of my days lurking in Debartolo Hall pretending to study. If you like fried pickles or Crime Junky podcasts, we'll get along just fine."
